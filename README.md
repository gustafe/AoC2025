# Advent of Code 2025

I use Perl for all the solutions.

Most assume the input data is in a file called `input.txt` in the
same directory as the file.

### A note on scoring

I award myself one point per star, but only if I manage to solve it
myself without help.

## TODO

Running score: 6 / 6

### Day 3: Lobby

Naive straightforward solution for part 1, recursive for part 2.

Score: 2

### Day 2: Gift Shop

It was faster solving this by thinking about than trying to find a
regex online to solve it.

Score: 2

### Day 1: Secret Entrance

We've gone over to 12 problems instead of 25, so it's to be expected
that the first day's difficulty has ramped up a bit compared to day 1
on previous years.

A problem like this practically invites off-by-one errors, and sure
enough, that's what I got. Luckily the test input covered most of the
corner cases.

Score: 2
