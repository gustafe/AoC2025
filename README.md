# Advent of Code 2025

I use Perl for all the solutions.

Most assume the input data is in a file called `input.txt` in the
same directory as the file.

### A note on scoring

I award myself one point per star, but only if I manage to solve it
myself without help.

## TODO

- Day 10 part 2

Running score: 19 / 20

### Day 10: Factory, part 1

I was really proud of solving part 1 without any help or hints, but
part 2 seems to be requiring some CS stuff I've never heard of, so
I'll be putting that in the back burner.

Score: 1

### Day 9: Movie Theater

Today was pretty fun! I went down some wrong paths but got to it in the end.

Score: 2

### Day 8: Playground

Finally we're getting into the harder problems... maybe I will regret
saying that.

Anyway, after doing my best trying to implement a graph from first
principles, I remember the [Graph
module](https://metacpan.org/dist/Graph/view/lib/Graph.pod)
exists. Some dicking around in the documentation got me what I needed.

This code barely finishes on my $5 VPS, but running on a Real
Computer(tm) gives the answers in about 15s.

Score: 2

### Day 7: Laboratories

Not my best work, but it's not been my best day either. 

Score: 2

### Day 6: Trash Compactor

Holy pythonic code, Batman - significant whitespace! 

This is my list favorite "advanced" AoC problem concept - not hard, just very very fiddly. 

Score: 2

### Day 5: Cafeteria

Easiest yet, I believe. Had some issues with off-by-one errors but
they were cleared up using testing data.

Score: 2

### Day 4: Printing Department

A nice easy problem. I have enough data to produce a nice heatmap, should I choose to.

Score: 2

### Day 3: Lobby

Naive straightforward solution for part 1, recursive for part 2.

Score: 2

### Day 2: Gift Shop

It was faster solving this by thinking about than trying to find a
regex online to solve it.

Score: 2

### Day 1: Secret Entrance

We've gone over to 12 problems instead of 25, so it's to be expected
that the first day's difficulty has ramped up a bit compared to day 1
on previous years.

A problem like this practically invites off-by-one errors, and sure
enough, that's what I got. Luckily the test input covered most of the
corner cases.

Score: 2
